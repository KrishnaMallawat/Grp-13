            <h2>History of Rajasthan</h2>
            <p>Rajasthan, meaning "The Abode of Rajas," has a rich history that dates back to the ancient Indus Valley
                Civilization. Kalibangan, a site in Rajasthan, offers insights into this era. The region was later ruled
                by the Rajputs, whose tales of valor and sacrifice continue to inspire. The majestic forts and palaces
                built during this period are testament to the architectural prowess of the Rajput kings.</p>
            <p>Following the Rajput era, Rajasthan saw various other rulers, including the Mughals and the British. Each
                of these periods left a distinct mark on the region's culture, architecture, and traditions. The Mughal
                influence is particularly evident in the intricate designs of many forts and palaces, while the British
                period introduced new administrative and educational systems.</p>
            <p>Today, Rajasthan is a vibrant state that proudly showcases its historical legacy through numerous
                festivals, fairs, and cultural events. The state's history is not just confined to textbooks but is a
                living, breathing part of everyday life, visible in its architecture, traditions, and the stories passed
                down through generations.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="culture">
            <h2>Cultural Heritage</h2>
            <p>Rajasthan's culture is a vibrant tapestry of traditional music, folk dances like Ghoomar and Kalbeliya,
                colorful attire, and unique art forms such as block printing and miniature paintings. The state is also
                renowned for its festivals like Pushkar Fair, Desert Festival, and Teej.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Music and Dance:</strong> Instruments like the sarangi and dhol accompany traditional folk
                    songs, while dances like Kalbeliya are internationally recognized. Ghoomar, traditionally performed
                    by women, is a dance of grace and elegance, often performed during festivities and special
                    occasions.</li>
                <li><strong>Art and Craft:</strong> From Sanganer block prints to Jaipur's blue pottery, Rajasthan
                    excels in intricate handicrafts. The state is also famous for its jewelry, especially Kundan and
                    Meenakari work, which are highly sought after both in India and abroad. The traditional attire of
                    Rajasthan, with its vibrant colors and intricate designs, is a visual treat during festivals and
                    cultural performances.</li>

                <li><strong>Cuisine:</strong> Savor dishes like dal baati churma, laal maas, and ghevar, showcasing a
                    rich culinary tradition. Rajasthani cuisine is known for its spicy flavors and unique preparations,
                    often influenced by the arid climate of the region. The use of lentils, grains, and dairy products
                    is prominent, creating a distinct and delectable palate.</li>

            </ul>
            <p>Rajasthan's cultural heritage is not just about its past but is a living tradition that continues to
                thrive in the present. The state's commitment to preserving and promoting its culture is evident in the
                numerous cultural festivals, fairs, and events held throughout the year, attracting tourists and
                cultural enthusiasts from around the globe.</p>
